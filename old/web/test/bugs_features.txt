Which brings me to a minor quibble. The info that shows up when you hover on the graph goes off-screen on the right side in Chrome. If I re-size my browser window the info-pop-up no longer works. If I go back to my original size the info-pop-up come back. If I re-size and re-do my search, the graph just gets wider and, therefore, the info-pop-up goes off-screen. If you're using a percentage of the browser width to size the graph, can we cut that down a few percent to be able to see the info-pop-up?
